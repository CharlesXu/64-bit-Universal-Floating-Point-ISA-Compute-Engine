## 64-bit-Universal-Floating-Point-ISA-Compute-Engine
(October 8, 2019) New 64-bit Universal Floating-Point ISA Compute Engine computes directly with human-readable decimal character sequences, binary64, 32, 16 or bfloat16 formatted numbers in any combination.  For more detailed information on this new 64-bit floating-point ISA, download the .pdf in this repository.

Within the next few weeks a Verilog RTL model of this new core will be available for free download from this repository.  However, for the time being, you will need to use the "free" version of Xilinx Vivado, which you can download from Xilinx website.

The compute engine will be strapped onto a RISC-V at the top level of the design, for "Rocket" versions, this configuration is referred to as the "Strap-on-Booster" (SOB) for Rocket chip.  For more information on this particular implementation click on the following link to the .pdf available in this repository.

This implementation of SOB will have a Fused Universal Neural Network (FuNN) eNNgine installed in it.  For more information on this, read the .pdf available at the following link and which is presently in this repository.
